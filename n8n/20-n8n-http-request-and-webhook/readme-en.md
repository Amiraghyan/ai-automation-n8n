## 🔧 How It Works

1. **API Request Principles**
    - Use everyday examples (McDonald's ordering) for comparison to help quick learning
    - Learn the five major RESTful API methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

    - Connect to Google Sheets to automatically record request results, time, and response content
    - Can set scheduled automatic execution to create website health monitoring
3. **Webhook Operating Principles**
    - Metaphorical explanation (like ride-hailing services Uber/Line Taxi) for easy understanding
    - Server actively reports back, achieving low latency and real-time performance, saving client polling
4. **n8n Webhook Implementation Demo**
    - Step-by-step setup of n8n Webhook Node to monitor specified health check URL
