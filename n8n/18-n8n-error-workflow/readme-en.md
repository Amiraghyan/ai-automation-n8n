## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Workflow Error Handling Setup**: Workflow must be switched to Active and configured with Error Workflow. Only when officially enabled can error notifications be automatically triggered.
2. **Simulate Error Generation**: Use Schedule Trigger to send an HTTP Request with intentionally invalid URL every 30 seconds to simulate real error scenarios.
3. **Multi-channel Notification Process**:
   - **Email Notification**: When errors occur, automatically send HTML emails with custom subjects and clear content marking all error details.
   - **Google Sheet Records**: Use Google Sheet to synchronously record error occurrence time, Workflow name, URL, execution ID, and error content.
   - **LINE Real-time Push**: Integrate LINE Messaging API to push messages containing error summary and tracking links, ensuring no errors are missed!
4. **Flexible Combination**: Choose single or combined use of different channels based on notification urgency and purpose.

## 🚀 Notification Method Selection Recommendations

* Need immediate response ➔ Choose LINE!
* Reduce interference, routine recording ➔ Use Email.
* Want long-term statistics, maintenance management ➔ Google Sheet.

> ⏰ **Reminder:** When testing, remember to "enable workflow" rather than just pressing the test button, otherwise Error Workflow won't activate!
