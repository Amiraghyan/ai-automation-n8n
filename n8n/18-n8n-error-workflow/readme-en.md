## üîß How It Works

1. **Workflow Error Handling Setup**: Workflow must be switched to Active and configured with Error Workflow. Only when officially enabled can error notifications be automatically triggered.
2. **Simulate Error Generation**: Use Schedule Trigger to send an HTTP Request with intentionally invalid URL every 30 seconds to simulate real error scenarios.
3. **Multi-channel Notification Process**:
   - **Email Notification**: When errors occur, automatically send HTML emails with custom subjects and clear content marking all error details.
   - **Google Sheet Records**: Use Google Sheet to synchronously record error occurrence time, Workflow name, URL, execution ID, and error content.
   - **LINE Real-time Push**: Integrate LINE Messaging API to push messages containing error summary and tracking links, ensuring no errors are missed!
4. **Flexible Combination**: Choose single or combined use of different channels based on notification urgency and purpose.
