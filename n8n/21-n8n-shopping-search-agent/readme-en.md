## 🔧 How It Works

### ChatGPT Shopping Assistant Workflow

1. **User inputs product requirements**: e.g., "Please find a $300 flight jacket"
2. **Connect to OpenAI Search**: E-commerce websites, actively recommend lists, compare prices, prices and features
3. **Frontend UI**: Display product carousels, tags, prices, descriptions and shopping links
4. **Data source**: Structured SEO/third-party online channel integration with real-time updates
5. **Open merchant product data free upload**: Automatically included in OpenAI recommendation list

### n8n AI Agent Shopping Search Workflow -> User experience doesn't win

1. **Connect to OpenAI Web Search API**: Use HTTP Request node to connect to OpenAI Web Search API, and directly issue queries based on user instructions
2. **AI Agent**: Return product list or API information that meets search criteria (such as keywords, prices, sellers, etc.)
3. **Integrate search returns**: Automatically organize into text lists/summaries, no frontend carousel or interactive UI
