## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Upgrade AI Agent to GPT-4.1**: Directly upgrade the AI Agent node model in n8n to GPT4.1, improving effectiveness while becoming cheaper.
2. **Import Think Tool Node**: In complex task workflows, AI Agent will go through "self-thinking" and logical confirmation via Think Tool before answering.
   - Business Logic: Contains multi-layer prompts, specifying analysis of different dimensions, improving decision consistency and accuracy.
   - Multi-step Reasoning: Return/exchange condition judgment, complex business decisions and personal schedule planning reasoning logic.
3. **Combine with Real Databases, such as CRM and Various Internal Business Tools and Systems**: Can connect order data, user history, risk scores and other multi-source information, providing data support for every task judgment.
4. **Dynamic Adjustment and Real Cases**:
   - 📦 E-commerce Case: AI customer service automatically suggests automatic returns or transfers to manual review based on orders and user behavior.
   - 📅 Schedule Assistant Case: AI can automatically check requirements, integrate calendar and email, and automatically arrange multi-step processes.
5. **Modular Architecture Design**: Think Tool separates complex judgment logic from the main Prompt, centralized management for easy subsequent adjustment and expansion.
